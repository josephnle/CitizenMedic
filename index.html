          <p class="lead">We know that many people have an “out of sight, out of mind” attitude about what to do when the niceties of civilization we take for granted stop working. It’s a false sense of comfort that doesn’t change your likelihood of being hit by a power outage, earthquake, flood or hurricane.</p>

          <h2>Getting prepared is easier <br/>and more affordable than you think</h2>
          <p class="lead">
            Throughout the workshops we’ve conducted, we know that one of the biggest impediments in getting people to act on their own personal disaster preparedness plan is that many view earthquake/flood/disaster prep with the binary notion that you’re either the bearded “prepper” guy living in the woods with 10,000 rounds of ammunition, surrounded by years of canned of food - or you are are normal person.
          </p>
          <p class="lead">
            The truth is that there is an entire spectrum of preparedness - and our goal is to help you move one notch over to the right.

            Citizen Medic is the creation of Kai Chang, a longtime Disaster Preparedness speaker for the American Red Cross and CPR/First Aid instructor. He has taught life-saving skills to thousands over the years through the Red Cross - spearheading workshops attended by corporate executives, technology leaders, Boy Scouts/Girl Scouts and low-income community groups. As a resident of Napa, CA, he survived the 2017 Napa fires and his experiences have sharpened his passion to offer life-saving disaster preparedness advice for his community.
